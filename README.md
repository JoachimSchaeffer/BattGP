# BattGP
## Python library for battery system modeling using (recursive spatiotemporal) Gaussian processes

This repository will soon contain the Python library BattGP. 
The library corresponds to the manuscript:
"Gaussian Process-based Online Health Monitoring and Fault Analysis of Lithium-Ion Battery Systems from Field Data" by Schaeffer et. al. 

We are finalizing the clean up and restructruing of the code and will upload the code shortly, please bear with us.

## Data

The data set is available on Zenodo: [https://zenodo.org/records/13715694](https://zenodo.org/records/13715694)

## Corresponding Manuscript
Please cite the manuscript if you use this library or associated data in your research.
