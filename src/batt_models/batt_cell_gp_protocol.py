class IBatteryCellGP(Protocol):
    """Interface for battery cell models.

    As the purpose of this repository is to research and evaluate different concepts,
    this interface is designed to be agnostic to the underlying model.
    Therefore only Python base datatypes and numpy arrays are used within this
    interface. This will cost some performance due to unnecessary conversions, but this
    should not be an issue for the purposes of this project.

    On the other side, the data structure is fixed:
    - There are four input signals, that are given in the following order:
        1. time in days
        2. battery current in A
        3. SOC in percent
        4. temperature in Â°C

    - There is one target variable
        1. internal resistance R in Ohm

    The input data is always given as a [N x 4] numpy array (even if there is only one
    dataset).
    The target data is always given as a [N] numpy vector.

    Also, every class that implements this interface should store the data used to build
    the model.
